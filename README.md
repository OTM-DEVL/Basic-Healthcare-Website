# Basic-Healthcare-Website
A small scale project that was built with basic HTML and CSS
This is a prototype version of a website that provides information on healthy living and tips to take care of ones self.
As shown, it doesn't have much but it possesses basic information about vital organs of the body and ways they can be taken care of. 
This is the current level of HTML and CSS I'm at and I hope to improve my skills further on.
