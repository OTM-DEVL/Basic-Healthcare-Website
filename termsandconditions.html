Disclaimers<br/>
The Website contains content generated by us (or on our behalf by medical authors). The content we provide via the Website is provided for general information purposes only. It is not set up to provide specific advice on which you should rely. In particular, the Website (and the information which may be accessed through it) is not a substitute for professional medical care by a qualified doctor or other healthcare professional. If you are not a healthcare professional then you should ALWAYS check with your doctor if you have any concerns about your condition or treatment and before taking, or not taking, any action on the basis of the content on our Website. If you are a healthcare professional then this information (including any professional reference material) is intended to support, not replace, your own knowledge, experience and judgement.

Many of the professionally authored links from the Website are to reputable institutions and societies and the content contained within can be a valuable source of information.

Any decision about your health or medical care based solely on information obtained from the internet could be dangerous.
